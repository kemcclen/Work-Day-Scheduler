A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Functionality 
- When opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- The timeblocks are colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    - Past:  ![#f8d3c5](https://placehold.co/15x15/f8d3c5/f8d3c5.png) `#f8d3c5`
    - Present: ![#dde6d5](https://placehold.co/15x15/dde6d5/dde6d5.png) `#dde6d5`
    - Future: ![#b9d9f5](https://placehold.co/15x15/b9d9f5/b9d9f5.png) `#b9d9f5`
- When a timeblock is clicked, the user can enter an event
- The user can save their event, even when the page is refreshed
